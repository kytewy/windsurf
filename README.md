## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Customize Your Project

1. **Fill out `prd.md`** with your specific project details
2. **Update `project-docs/`** files with your requirements:
   - Define your app flows in `app_flow.md`
   - Specify your database schema in `db_schema.md`
   - Choose your tech stack in `tech_stack.md`
   - Plan your implementation in `implementation_plan.md`

### 2. Configure Windsurf Rules

The `windsurf-rules/` directory contains modular rule files that guide your AI agent:

- **`project-guidelines.md`**: Core development practices
- **`documentation-standards.md`**: Documentation requirements
- **`tech-stack-guidelines.md`**: Technology-specific guidelines

### 3. Start Development

With this foundation, your AI agent will:

- ✅ Always reference your documentation before generating code
- ✅ Follow your specific coding standards and conventions
- ✅ Implement features according to your planned architecture
- ✅ Maintain consistency across your entire project

## 🎯 Key Principles

This setup follows the **80% Planning, 20% Execution** methodology:

1. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear requirements prevent costly refactors
2. **AI Agent Context**: Detailed rules ensure consistent code generation
3. **Modular Structure**: Easy to maintain and update as projects evolve
4. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in standards for testing, security, and performance

## 📚 Documentation Philosophy

- **PRD First**: Always start with clear product requirements
- **Modular Docs**: Separate concerns into focused documentation files
- **AI-Friendly**: Structure documentation for optimal AI comprehension
- **Living Documents**: Update docs as the project evolves

## 🔧 Development Workflow

1. **Plan**: Update documentation before major changes
2. **Implement**: Let AI generate code following your established patterns
3. **Review**: Use git for frequent commits and change tracking
4. **Iterate**: Refine rules and docs based on development experience

## 🛡️ Best Practices

- **Git Safety Net**: Commit frequently for easy rollbacks
- **Component Isolation**: Build and test features in isolation
- **Clear Communication**: Ask AI for clarification on complex tasks
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep docs current with implementation
