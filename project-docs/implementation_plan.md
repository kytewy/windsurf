- [ ] Monitor initial user feedback
- [ ] Plan post-launch iterations

## Post-Launch: Maintenance & Iteration

### Ongoing Tasks
- [ ] Monitor application performance
- [ ] Address user feedback and bug reports
- [ ] Plan and implement new features
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Database maintenance and optimization

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Performance:** Monitor query performance, implement indexing
- **API Rate Limits:** Implement caching and request optimization
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Regular security audits and updates

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep:** Stick to MVP features, defer nice-to-haves
- **Technical Debt:** Allocate time for refactoring in each phase
- **External Dependencies:** Have fallback plans for third-party services

## Success Criteria

### Phase Completion Criteria
- All checklist items completed
- Tests passing with target coverage
- Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
- Code review and approval from team

### Launch Readiness Criteria
- Core user workflows fully functional
- Security review completed
- Performance testing passed
